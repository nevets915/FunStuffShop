        <p>2014 Fuji Feather CX 1.1<br/></p>

        <p>If your commute involves diving through traffic on the pavement and dodging squirrels on the gravel bike paths, check out Fuji's Feather CX 1.1. It's got an A6-SL aluminum frame that's light so you can get where you're going fast, and the carbon fork up front makes short work of road vibration. It rolls over the roughest roads and gravel thanks to light and fast Vera Terra wheels, while Vera CityWide tires hook up in the corners for exceptional stability. And, with ever-reliable Shimano Sora drivetrain components providing the powerhouse, you know you'll get smooth, accurate shifts every time. Top it all off with Oval Concepts components that are tough and light, and you've got an all-season commuter with the guts for off-road adventure!</p>
